# Central Axis Clone

This project is a responsive clone of the [Central Axis](https://www.centralaxis.com) landing page.  
It closely replicates the original’s layout, typography, colors, animations, and overall performance—reflecting my best effort to recreate the design and experience with high accuracy.

> **Note:** Not associated with Central Axis. Built as a frontend practice project.
